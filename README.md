# toDo-angular


a simple ToDo web page built with AngularJS

### Usage

the web page is standalone.  Download and open the index.html

angular.js; underscore.js and bootstrap.css are not local but pointing at CDN's

### TO DO (ironic?)

- ~~no styling~~
- no persistence (not local or backend storage)

### Demo

since this is a simple static app (static in the sense that it is *just* html, css, and javascript) , I've got a [DEMO](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3967166/ng/todo1/index.html) version hosted on dropbox.
